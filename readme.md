# Manticore

This is the Laravel/Vue based backend to the suite previously in development as Three Beasts.
This backend populates the data through a web browser that is used to populate the apps on iOS (Nemean) and Android (Chimera), whose repositories can be found on my profile. 

Development ceased when Google and Apple decided to restrict automated apps from their respective marketplaces. The code is therefore aged, and up to use at your own discretion. 

At the point of ceasing development, Vue was beginning to be uesd to implement the drag-and-drop GUI that would replace the blank fields from the previously working MVP that was driven by Laravel alone.

Many of the todo: statements found in this code are based on fixing GUI issues from Vue, as well as areas that need to be addressed on per-app bases.
